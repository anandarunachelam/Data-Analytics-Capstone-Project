# Data-Analytics-Capstone-Project
## Project Description: 
  A capstone project demonstrating the Data Analysis and Recommendations done to Head of Sales at CS Tay (a local customer in Singapore) who is looking to devise a data driven strategy around customer segmentation and price intelligence across the Top 10 products at a     
  Customer (Supermarket and Retail) and Product Category (Raw, RTE and RTC).  The analylsis has been done using Python Coding based on the Sales Data provided by the company tp oredict prices and customer segments.
## Customer Segmentation:
    RFM, which stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary, a popular marketing and customer segmentation technique has been used to analyze and categorize their customer base
    It helped to:
      • Understand customer behavior
      • Identify most valuable customers
      • Tailor marketing strategies
      K-Means Clustering Algorithm has been applied to do the RFM Analysis for Customer Segmentation.  
## Own Price and Cross Price Elasticity Analysis:
  Logistic Regression was used for this prediction of price elasticity. Price Elasticity identifies relationship between price and sales quantity per product; used to estimate new sales quantity and optimized prices for margin.
  Built a framework to calculate the price elasticies leveraging ML models.  The framework consists of:
      • Collect Data
      • Prepare Data
      . Create ML models
      . Extract Elasticities
  Own-Price elasticities measures the impact of change in volume with changing price.  Classic Logistic regression modelling has be utilized.
  Cross-Price Elasticities measures the impact of the change in relative volume with change in relative price using statistical modelling. Substitute and Complementary Products understanding used in Cross Price Elasticity.
